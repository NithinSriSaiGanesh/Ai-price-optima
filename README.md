# AI-PriceOptima 💰📊  
### Machine Learning–Driven Dynamic Pricing System

## 📌 Overview
AI-PriceOptima is an end-to-end **dynamic pricing platform** that uses machine learning models to recommend optimal product prices.  
The system dynamically adjusts prices based on **historical sales, inventory levels, demand patterns, and market conditions** to maximize revenue while maintaining customer trust.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design a scalable dynamic pricing system
- Predict optimal prices using ML techniques
- Improve revenue, conversion rate, and profit margin
- Ensure pricing transparency and policy compliance
- Provide real-time pricing insights through dashboards

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system follows a modular and scalable architecture:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and demand modeling
- Machine learning–based price prediction
- API-based serving layer
- Visualization and KPI monitoring dashboard

---

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Kaggle Dynamic Pricing Dataset
   - Statso Case Study datasets
   - Historical sales and inventory data

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Demand elasticity
   - Seasonality trends
   - Competitor price index
   - Inventory health indicators

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - XGBoost
   - LightGBM
   - (Optional) Reinforcement Learning
   - Metrics: revenue lift, profit margin, conversion rate

4. **Pricing Recommendation Engine**
   - Business rule constraints
   - Minimum and maximum price thresholds
   - Profit margin enforcement

5. **API & Deployment**
   - FastAPI-based pricing service
   - Dockerized for scalability

6. **Visualization & Dashboard**
   - React.js frontend
   - Plotly.js for KPI visualization
   - Real-time monitoring of pricing strategies
